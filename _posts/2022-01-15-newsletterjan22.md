##### Cauvery Water in all blocks in Greenage. Improvements in water quality. 

Cauvery water distribution system to all the blocks was commissioned on 8th Dec. A Centralized anti-scaling unit is  now deployed in each block, which will help in substantial reduction in scale formation. 

##### Pending Handover works from builder - Solar Water Heaters & Juniper Lobby

More than 80% of the willing flats on the top floors have been connected to solar water heating systems.  GOA is working closely with the builder to complete  balance in a phased manner.
