This week is a beginning of case study, where I will interview people and also give them a probing kit.  Lets start with the basics.

What is Empathy.  Its 







  Last week I listed down people I will be interviewing and I called them up yesterday and fixed time with them.

The Primary goal for this week is interview 5 people and document the interview as well. In case you have missed my previous post this activity is done as a part of case study.  Case study is part of IDF design thinking curriculum.  

Currently I have three of my contacts who have agreed for the interview and understand what I am trying to accomplish.  

I have one interview scheduled for today, let's do some interview preparation:

Case Study Topic :  **Create a smartphone app which will help people improve their fitness.**

Target Group : Your target group is people who *want* to exercise more, but who—for various reasons—don’t get around to it.

Find out:

1. **Why** your participants **want to** exercise;
2. **What** concretely happens when they **do** manage to exercise;
3. **What** concretely happens when something **prevents** them from exercising.

User Interview's purpose :

1. To find out about participants habit and motivation.

Suggested Questions:

1. How and where they exercise.
2. Whats happens when they don't exercise.
3. Why they want to exercise more

Make an audio recording.
