This week is the beginning of the case study, where I will interview people and also give them a probing kit.  Let's start with the basics.

What is Empathy?

To do justice in explaining this I created an audio-only story to share my understanding.

Last week I listed down people I will be interviewing and I called them up yesterday and fixed a time with them.

The primary goal for this week is to interview 5 people and document the interview as well. In case you have missed my previous post this activity is done as a part of the case study.  The case study is part of the IDF design thinking curriculum.  

**Case Study Topic:**  **Create a smartphone app which will help people improve their fitness.**

**Target Group:** Your target group is people who *want* to exercise more, but who—for various reasons—don’t get around to it.

Here is the guidance I received from IDF to conduct the interview:

1. **Why** your participants **want to** exercise;
2. **What** concretely happens when they **do** manage to exercise;
3. **What** concretely happens when something **prevents** them from exercising.

**User Interview's purpose:**

1. To find out about participants habit and motivation.

**Suggested Questions**

1. How and where they exercise.
2. Whats happens when they don't exercise.
3. Why they want to exercise more

I also came up with the following questions:

1. Ask candidates about there family members, who are they what they do
2. What kind of work you do.
3. Do you suffer from any Illness?
4. Do you follow any diet?
5. What is there favourite activity for exercising
6. Do they use any fitness app or activity tracker?
