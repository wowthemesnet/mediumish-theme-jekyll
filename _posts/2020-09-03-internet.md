Once you apply for a connection from any of the service providers, they will do the installation based on your needs. 

## Wired connections to rooms within the flats
Wherever possible, it is advisable to use a wired connection as they are always faster and reliable than Wi-Fi connections. For details on how to leverage the cables, consult the Greenage electricians as they are well equiped and well verse in the cable systems in all flats in Greenage. You can set-up either a Cat 5e[^cat5e] or Cat 6[^cat6] cables for wired connections within the home. 

## Wi-Fi connections to rooms within the flats

Be aware that any Wi-Fi router that you use will have its signal limited due to the thick concrete walls in Greenage. You are advised to use Wi-Fi or LAN extenders, or invest in a [Wi-Fi mesh system](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/what-is-mesh-wifi-network-7a17f10322f1). The thoroughput and function of your [Wi-Fi](https://oinam.fyi/technology/wi-fi/) signal will depend on the types, and specs of the routers you choose.
