<p>Waste segregation at source is mandatory by law for the apartments of our size. All the flats must follow the below guidelines for segregation, to comply with BBMP guidelines.</p>   

<p><b>Important:</b> Housekeeping staff will not pick up waste from the flats that do not segregate waste. As per BBMP rules for bulk generators, failure to segregate waste will attract a penalty of Rs.500 for the first instance and subsequently Rs. 1000 per instance</p> 


#### Garbage Collection Timings, Bin Location and Collection

###### Wet Waste, Reject Waste and Dry Waste 

- Picked up at Doorstep between 9.30AM - 12.30PM. Any Waste placed outside after 9.30AM will not picked up. In such cases, Residents must take the waste inside and not leave it out. 
- All Waste must be kept next to the door-step on the left, right or opposite of the front door of the apartment, while taking care to ensure the walkways are not blocked. Do not keep the bins in the main hallway opposite the lifts. 
- Residents are expected to take the empty bins inside immediately after the pick-up and not leave the bins in the common areas.

###### Debris waste
