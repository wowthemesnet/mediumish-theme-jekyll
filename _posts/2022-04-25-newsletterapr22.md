A night nurse has been appointed to attend to any health emergency in our complex. Over the past month many emergency calls have been attended. 

> The Direct Emergency Number to reach night nurse between 8pm and 8am is +91 89519 92025.  

The association has bought an additional wheelchair for use by residents in an emergency. Another wheelchair and Oxygen cylinder ( portable) have been donated by our generous residents.  

A free vaccination camp under the aegis of BBMP, for 12-14 year olds was held on 23rd April. 30 youngsters availed of the opportunity to get a Corbevax vaccine at their doorstep.  

##### Events and Celebrations

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/updates//apr22/collage.jpg" alt="GOA" /></p>

Holi was celebrated by the residents on March 17-19, with great fervor and joy. The three day event started with a Holika dahan, the traditional fire ritual ceremony, on the 17th evening. 18th March, Rangon ki Holi saw residents turn out in large numbers for the rain dance with an awesome DJ, and splashes of color.  

The Grand Finale to the two day event was Holi unplugged..a musical evening with the singing idol, Ravi Tripathi and troupe, who mesmerized the audience with his voice, and foot tapping vocals. Holi Milan in the evening saw a shopping extravaganza, followed by another flea market a week later.  

After years of isolation, Greenage was alive with fun and frolic!! The photos speak for themselves!!  

##### Clubhouse and Amenities

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/updates/apr22/pool.jpg" alt="GOA" /></p>

After months of closing due to COVID, the Club House is abuzz with activity, dance, yoga, aerobics, karate, chess and of course the gym is always busy with health enthusiasts. 

The three pools are now functioning well and the facilities team is working hard to keep the water clean and blue. We hope the residents are enjoying the pool in the heat of the summer. 

> Each of our 3 pools is closed for maintenance on one of the days Mon/Tue/Wed. All pools are closed between 1-3 pm. Please check and follow the timings to avoid inconvenience. Needless to reiterate, caps and swim wear and pool etiquette is essential!!

We are striving to make the library operational in May for the benefit of our book lovers of all ages. Watch out for the communication on this topic. 

##### Updates on Infrastructure and Maintenance

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/updates/apr22/library.jpg" alt="GOA" /></p>

- The excessively worn out road surface has been relaid for smooth driving at the Main gate.
- Juniper lobby renovation by Salarpuria Sattva is almost complete and expected to be restored to its imposing state by the end of April.
- A sustained and continuous effort has been made to clean all drains and stop leakages in preparation for the monsoon ahead
- Water seepage issues in the Lift pits of Ebony block B wing have been rectified.Also Water proofing work in the courtyards of H block and E block have been completed.
- An additional 41 CCTV cameras have been installed to avoid blind spots and provide better coverage and security.
- Signs for all blocks have been put up in the LB and UB and at important locations in the complex. Segregation, debris disposal parking etc are all marked for convenience.
- All defective lift buttons have been replaced, a total of 140. Care whilst handling can reduce damage to lifts.


##### Finance

In the last 3 months close to 45 lakhs has been spent on civil repairs, enhancing CCTV coverage and improving Water Treatment Plants. Overall our expenses remain within the budgeted amount of 1.09 crores/month. Regular contributions into the sinking fund are being made for future big ticket expenses. 

> All Residents are urged to discuss and settle the dues pending with the builder without further delay. As a collateral against these pending dues, the builder has held back 1.5 crores from the corpus payment to the association. The pending corpus amount, once paid, will generate additional interest and benefit all the units.

Despite repeated reminders, about 150 apartments are still shown as defaulter by the builder. To ensure the corpus deficit is addressed, the move-out, move-in and interiors are allowed only after the dues with SS are fully settled. Also, the residents continue to bear the brunt of paying ₹3.9 per sq ft as against ₹3.5 paid by the flats whose corpus is fully received by the association.

Also please clear your regular maintenance bills (quarterly) and gas bills (monthly) to avoid disconnection of maintenance services. Restoration of services will take 24 hours considering the many intermediate steps needed. We are confident that residents appreciate the necessity of these steps to enforce the financial discipline we need to keep this society going. 

##### Envirionment, Landscaping and Gardening 

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/updates//apr22/garden1.jpg" alt="GOA" /></p>

Implementation of drip irrigation has started from April to improve the watering of the plants in Greenage. 

The Amphitheater has been opened for use and it is good to see many residents enjoying the lush green lawns. We request residents to avoid active sports and cycles that could damage the lawns. Pets have to be avoided in the amphitheater area.  

We are bringing a lot of new plants to improve the green cover and bring a diverse flora to Greenage.
